# hailstone-sequence
---
A python program with looping and recursion to demonstrate and visualize the hailstone sequence with any given number.

Something I'll work on in my spare time, the Hailstone Sequence is a mathematical head-scratcher that people have been trying to break. So far, any number up to 2^68 falls into the hailstone sequence.
